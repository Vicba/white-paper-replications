# GloVe

My implementation/understanding of GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation), a popular technique used in natural language processing (NLP) for creating word embeddings.

While the concept of the co-occurrence matrix was straightforward, it took me a very long time to fully grasp the working/details of the GloVe paper and its implementation.

Also learned about xavier initialization in this one :).
