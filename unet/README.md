# Unet

The U-Net architecture consists of an encoder that downsamples the input image to capture features and a decoder that upsamples it to produce a segmentation map, forming a "U" shape. Skip connections between corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder help preserve spatial information, enhancing the model's performance in segmentation tasks.
